#### Project Summary
Think about the significance of a coin. They have traveled the world and been touched by a variety of hands. Some have been stuck in between a couch cushion for the last few years while others are showcased on displays. They’ve been traded and lost, saved and spent. Coins have a rich story that needs to be shared. COINS: A journey through a rich culture of collections digital humanities projects sparked this interest in me that I never knew I had. When first entering the website you are greeted with a message. The message invites you to recall your childhood memories of playing with your parents' coins and to join them in their jumbled collection to do it all over again, but this time virtually and with many more coins. This virtual coin collection comes from the Münzkabinett Berlin museum. From there we begin. 

We open up to an array of coins spread throughout the screen. You have the option of sorting the coins from:
* Country
* Region
* Minting place (A mint is an industrial facility which manufactures coins that can be used as currency)
* Period
* Material
* Weight
* Diameter
* Earliest date
* Latest date
You also have the option of sorting the coins into two categories of your choosing. You can drag, move, click on any of the coins to get a deeper description.

#### Design
It was built with PixiJS, d3 and React
26,000 coins are displayed on the website out of the 500,000 total coins from the museum.

#### Who is the project for?
This is a way to show off all of the coins, as many of them are hidden where no one can see them. Because there are so many coins, it's difficult to choose which ones to exhibit.
This website is for everyone, however it is mostly for historians interested in getting a taste of the past. It also allows coin experts to see thousands of coins that are typically in safe keeping.
