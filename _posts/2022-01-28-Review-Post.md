### **Project Summary** 
Think about the significance of a coin. They have traveled the world and been touched by a variety of hands. Some have been stuck in between a couch cushion for the last few years while others are showcased on displays. They’ve been traded and lost, saved and spent. Coins have a rich story that needs to be shared. COINS: A journey through a rich culture of collections digital humanities projects sparked this interest in me that I never knew I had. When first entering the website you are greeted with a message. The message invites you to recall your childhood memories of playing with your parents' coins and to join them in their jumbled collection to do it all over again, but this time virtually and with many more coins. This virtual coin collection comes from the Münzkabinett Berlin museum. From there we begin.

### Organization

We open up to an array of coins spread throughout the screen. You have the option of sorting the coins from:
* Country
* Region
* Minting place (A mint is an industrial facility which manufactures coins that can be used as currency)
* Period
* Material
* Weight
* Diameter
* Earliest date
* Latest date

You also have the option of sorting the coins into two categories of your choosing. You can drag, move, click on any of the coins to get a deeper description.

### Design
It was built with PixiJS, d3 and React. 26,000 coins are displayed on the website out of the 500,000 total coins from the museum.

### Who is the project for?
This is a way to show off all of the coins, as many of them are hidden where no one can see them. Because there are so many coins, it's difficult to choose which ones to exhibit. This website is for everyone, however it is mostly for historians interested in getting a taste of the past. It also allows coin experts to see thousands of coins that are typically in safe keeping.

### Findings
This project provides coin collectors with the incredible ability to visually examine thousands of coins. When there are hundreds of coins to choose from, it can be overwhelming to stare at the screen. Any coin can be sorted, organized, and moved around, but there is no method to look up specific coins or a specific type of coin from the different categories. As a participant in the study, I have the impression that I am not being given the opportunity to examine all of the coins. A close-up photo of each coin could be a solution to the problem, but it would be a highly time-consuming fix.

Each coin has an incredible amount of detail (as no two are alike), although they are relatively small. Putting your mouse over a coin to gain information on it can be difficult at times. When it comes to sorting through the coins, the layout is really useful. There are two layout options: a large pile of coins or coins placed out in a line, clumped together with their group. These possibilities are ideal, however because there are only two sorts of layouts, many coins are over-lapped and may not be seen. Through my own curiosity I wonder if there is a way to calculate on average how many times certain coins are picked from the bunch and examined. 

To make sorting out easier, there could be a search button on the front page to hunt for a specific region or material kind. It appears complicated with such a long range of regions, materials, and sizes. On a laptop, you can zoom in to look at the coins. I realize someone without a laptop does not have the option of zooming. Incorporating a way to look closer at the coins directly on the site itself will benefit all users.

### Wrap up
It is clear that a significant amount of time was spent on this project. I like that there are few words and mostly coins because it emphasizes the project's importance. Coins are being forgotten as the world becomes more digital. Since getting more into this activity, I've realized that I stop and pick up a coin from the floor to examine it. I look at the design, shape, and year. I appreciate its value more. I'm curious as to how this coin came to be here today. It sparked my interest in a way I wasn't aware of, and this project is for more than just the coin experts.
