***About me

**My name is Julia Basauri :) 

I transferred to Christopher Newport University spring of 2020 all the way from Oregon. I know, I know **Oregon??**. I get asked the question “why virginia?” all the time. Well let me tell you the short version. My sister went to school in Boston and after graduating got a job at the shipyard right down the street from CNU. One day she was passing the school and sent me a picture out of the blue.

As cliche as it sounds, that was the minute I knew I had to come to CNU. So I said “why not?” and now I’m a junior majoring in Social Work with a minor in psychology. Talk about fate, am I right?
