## My name is Julia Basauri :) 

I transferred to Christopher Newport University spring of 2020 all the way from Oregon. I know, I know **OREGON??** I get asked the question “why virginia?” all the time. Well let me tell you the short version. My sister went to school in Boston and after graduating got a job at the shipyard right down the street from CNU. One day she was passing campus and randomly decided to send a picture to our family group chat.

As cliche as it sounds, that was the minute I knew I had to come to CNU. So I said “why not?” and now I’m a junior majoring in Social Work with a minor in psychology. Talk about fate, am I right? 

#### Adventures!
Moving across the country was the scariest decision of my life, and yet possibly the best choice I've ever made. Since moving here I have met some of the greatest people that have become so important to my life. I met my amazing friends through my involvement at school. A small list of just a few things i'm involved with on campus: 
* President of the Club Volleyball team
* Greek life ΓΦΒ
* Transfer ambassador where I met my [**Best Friend!**](https://www.instagram.com/sheenakron/)
* Volunteer with the HESED project new to cnu
* work as a Peer mentor for the Center for Academic and Success 


I **LOVE** meeting new people on campus so [reach](https://www.instagram.com/julia.basauri/) out to me! And lets meet :) and if you ever catch me on campus…

(here is a picture for reference when looking for me on campus)

#### Don’t be afraid to say hi (because I most likely will be).

#### But just know that this is what you will probably actually see walking around campus.

### Deeper meanings
For this class I may be satisfying a WI requirement but for me it's a way to improve my writing. I learned from a very young age that I have [dyslexia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iVcTPRShBA) and ever since I was little I’ve been self conscious about my ability to write. I've grown immensely since elementary school but there is always room for improvement. 

I am also very interested in this class because In today's day and age technology is running the world. As a social work major I want to use digital humanities as an advantage to improve my field of work. As my dad always says, the next language is coding.

This wouldn't be a "about me blog" if I didn't at one point talk about my pets. At home, in Oregon, I’ve got a wrinkly old bulldog named Nacho who is constantly drooling. My sister and I, during the pandemic, adopted a black cat that we named Jacob (and yes we named him after the character in Twilight). And to emotionally support me, I have my tiny little beta fish A$AP rocky on my desk. 

Thats enough about me... For now.
