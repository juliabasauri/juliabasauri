# About me

## My name is Julia Basauri :) 

I transferred to Christopher Newport University spring of 2020 all the way from Oregon. I know, I know **OREGON??**. I get asked the question “why virginia?” all the time. Well let me tell you the short version. My sister went to school in Boston and after graduating got a job at the shipyard right down the street from CNU. One day she was passing the school and sent me a picture out of the blue.

As cliche as it sounds, that was the minute I knew I had to come to CNU. So I said “why not?” and now I’m a junior majoring in Social Work with a minor in psychology. Talk about fate, am I right? 

Moving across the country was the scariest decision of my life, and yet possibly the best choice I've ever made. Since moving here I have met some of the greatest people that have become so important to my life. I met my amazing friends through my involvement at school. A small list of just a few things i'm involved with on campus: 
* President of the CLub Volleyball team
* Greek life ΓΦΒ
* Work with the HESED project new to cnu
* Peer mentor for the Center for Academic and Success 
* Transfer ambassador
