### Definition of DH

Coming into the first day of class, I had no idea what Digital Humanities was. Before Googling the term I ended up breaking down the two words. The term **"digital"** implied that it had something to do with technology. While **"humanities"** refers to the human race.
So I came up with my own definition of DH, which was as follows:
 
“Digital humanities is the combination of human society and culture studies and digital data put together. It is a new form of learning that is challenging our abilities. Creating new means of communication and knowledge.”
 
Throughout the semester, I discovered that the definition of DH is much more straightforward than I had previously thought. I now think of DH as digitizing the human race and displaying it digitally. It's an advanced mode of communication. One important piece that was missing from my original definition is that DH is answering a question.
 
 
### Course Content
 
The Social Work side of me had doubts about DH at first. In the United States, a big group of people do not have access to the digital world. So, how are they supposed to be a part of this transformation? Once we began our readings in class I started to recognize why DH is important to even those outside of the digital world.
 
In particular "A Short Guide to Digital Humanities" by Burdick influenced my experience as to how I see DH projects.  A "project," according to Burdick, is more than just an action; it is also a promise for the future. DH isn't just answering questions; it's also shedding new light to the upcoming generation and the technological world we live in. A chance for more opportunities.
 
Aside from articles about understanding what DH is, we read a lot of helpful articles about improving our writing skills. Anne Lamott's "Shitty First Drafts" is an example. This article was fantastic because it taught me to take my time when writing and to be okay with a terrible first draft. After reading Lamott's article, I felt a lot more confident in my writing.

Another example is Kara Pernice's "Text Scanning Patterns: Eyetracking Evidence," which made me realize how important a project's layout is if you want to capture your audience's attention. Each reading focused on a different aspect of my writing and pushed me to improve.
 
Looking back, there isn't a single article that didn't help me in some way. Having to condense the reading in order to highlight the most important parts to tweet pushed me to consider DH in a new perspective. All of the readings were organized in such a way that we could work on small tasks at a time, which I believe was done very thoughtfully.
 
### DH assignments 
 
My dad always believed, and still believes, that coding will be the next generation's language. As a result, I worked with a variety of programs as a kid. I hadn’t touched coding in years but working with Github brought it all back to me. Anything involving Github was my favorite project. I felt like a pro once you got the hang of the program. It felt good to see your work turn from a code:

The About Me blog, on the other hand, was by far my favorite. I was able to be very creative because I was given the freedom to do so. My blog was a little too creative, but I had a lot of fun creating it. Every class assignment served a purpose, and as a result, this has been a very impactful class.

### Progress Within the Class
 
The weekly routine of two tweets and a response seemed tedious at first. I noticed that as the semester progressed, I became better at summarizing articles and being more concise. A lot of the work we did in class has transferred to my other classes and helped me become a better writer.

The Dracula project compelled me to focus on a single passage and fully comprehend its meaning. Github has given me the opportunity to be one of the few people who can read coding. My ability to cater to an audience improved after I learned how to write a grant. The peer reviews forced me to be open with my classmates and practice not being self-conscious about my work.

I can honestly say that my writing skills have improved with each assignment and reading. I am more confident in my ability to write, and I also enjoy having people read my work, which I never did before. When I registered for this class, I knew I was stepping outside of my comfort zone, and for that I am grateful. I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to truly challenge themselves and improve as a student.
