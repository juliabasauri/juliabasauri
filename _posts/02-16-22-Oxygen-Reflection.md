# Dracula's Guest
### Julia Basauri

#### Summary 
Dracula's Guest is about a curious Englishman who is staying at a Transylvania hotel. He decides to venture out into the night despite being told to stay in the carriage. He gets lost in a cemetery in the middle of a snowstorm, surrounded by darkness and wolves. He is then awoken by soldiers who claim to have been sent by none other than Dracula himself to protect the Englishman.

#### My Job
The part of the story I'm coding for this assignment is just before the climax. The author is setting the stage for the downfall to occur in this section, as well as building suspense.

I'm only responsible for coding a few things in my section of the text. My father always believed that coding would be the next language for my generation when I was growing up. As a result, he'd have me practice on simple coding programs. Understanding the purpose of coding was simple at first, but actually understanding the different patterns to coding can be difficult.

My thought processes were exactly the same when we first started coding. It was intimidating and frightening when we first opened Oxygen. You quickly learn that it is truly simple if you carefully follow the steps. Each change serves a purpose, and while mastering the fundamentals took some time, it was not too difficult to grasp. Because it felt too easy at times, I felt like I was overthinking my steps. It's almost as if I'm missing a crucial step, but once you preview your work and see that you did everything correctly, you feel accomplished.

#### Overview
The Oxygen program's basic coding steps were simple to follow and complete. It's reassuring to see a green light indicating that your progress is correct. While each programming site has its own set of goals and objectives, I'm interested in learning more about Oxygen and how it can assist me in my future career. I believe that coding can help you achieve your goals in life, but I'd like to dive deeper into what those advantages are.
